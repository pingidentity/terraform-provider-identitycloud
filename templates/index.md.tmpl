# PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud Provider

The PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud provider is used to manage Advanced Identity Cloud tenants. For more information on Advanced Identity Cloud, see the [documentation](https://docs.pingidentity.com/pingoneaic/latest/).

## Getting Started

To get started using the PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud Terraform provider, first you'll need an active PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud subscription.  Learn more about PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud and request a free demo at [pingidentity.com](https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/pingone-advanced-identity-cloud.html).

### Configure PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud for Terraform access

For detailed instructions on how to prepare PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud for Terraform access, see the [PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud getting started guide](https://terraform.pingidentity.com/getting-started/pingone-advanced-identity-cloud/#configure-pingone-advanced-identity-cloud-for-terraform-access) at [terraform.pingidentity.com](https://terraform.pingidentity.com).

### Ping Identity Developer Experiences

For code examples showing how to configure the PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud service using Terraform, the following resources are available:

- [Tutorials and use-case examples](https://terraform.pingidentity.com/examples/) at [terraform.pingidentity.com](https://terraform.pingidentity.com).

## Provider Authentication

This provider supports two forms of authentication.

### Service Account

You can provide a service account ID and private key for use with the provider. These will be used to retrieve the access token necessary for interacting with the API. The service account must have the following scopes:
- `fr:idc:certificate:*`
- `fr:idc:content-security-policy:*`
- `fr:idc:cookie-domain:*`
- `fr:idc:custom-domain:*`
- `fr:idc:esv:*`
- `fr:idc:promotion:*`
- `fr:idc:sso-cookie:*`

For information on preparing the PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud tenant for Terraform access, see the [PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud getting started guide](https://terraform.pingidentity.com/getting-started/pingone-advanced-identity-cloud/#configure-pingone-advanced-identity-cloud-for-terraform-access) at [terraform.pingidentity.com](https://terraform.pingidentity.com).

These values can be provided in the provider configuration with `service_account_id` and `service_account_private_key`, or via the corresponding environment variables.

Example using provider configuration fields: 

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider-jwk.tf" }}

Example using environment variables:

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider-env.tf" }}

{{ codefile "shell" (printf "%s" "examples/provider/provider-env.sh") }}

### Access Token

If you would prefer to provide an access token directly, you can do so with the `access_token` attribute, or the corresponding environment variable. For information on obtaining an access token to use with this provider, see the [documentation](https://docs.pingidentity.com/pingoneaic/latest/developer-docs/authenticate-to-rest-api-with-access-token.html).

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider-at.tf" }}

### Custom User Agent information

This Terraform provider allows custom information to be appended to the default user agent string (that includes Terraform provider version information) by setting the `PINGONE_AIC_TF_APPEND_USER_AGENT` environment variable.  This can be useful when troubleshooting issues with Ping Identity Support, or adding context to HTTP requests.

{{ codefile "shell" (printf "%s" "examples/provider/provider-custom-user-agent.sh") }}

## Schema

### Required

- `tenant_environment_fqdn` (String, Sensitive) The fully qualified domain name of the tenant environment. Default value can be set with the `PINGAIC_TF_TENANT_ENV_FQDN` environment variable.

### Optional

- `access_token` (String, Sensitive) Access token for the PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud Rest API. Default value can be set with the `PINGAIC_TF_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable. If `access_token` is provided, `service_account_id` and `service_account_private_key` should not be provided.
- `service_account_id` (String, Sensitive) Service account ID for the PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud Rest API. The service account must have the following scopes: `fr:idc:certificate:*`, `fr:idc:content-security-policy:*`, `fr:idc:cookie-domain:*`, `fr:idc:custom-domain:*`, `fr:idc:esv:*`, `fr:idc:promotion:*`, `fr:idc:sso-cookie:*`. Default value can be set with the `PINGAIC_TF_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID` environment variable. If `service_account_id` and `service_account_private_key` are provided, `access_token` should not be provided.
- `service_account_private_key` (String, Sensitive) Service account private key for the PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud Rest API. Default value can be set with the `PINGAIC_TF_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable. If `service_account_id` and `service_account_private_key` are provided, `access_token` should not be provided.
