# identitycloud_custom_domain_verify (Resource)

Resource to verify a custom domain.

Any custom domains will be validated by AIC when set. CNAME record verification can also be deactivated by submitting a ticket. See [the documentation on custom domains](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/idcloud/latest/realms/custom-domains.html) for more information.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "identitycloud_custom_domain_verify" "example" {
  name = "mydomain.example.com"
  timeouts = {
    create = "30m"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The canonical name of the domain to be validated.

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m", as a time to wait for DNS record changes to propagate for verification. Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). The default is 1 minute.
